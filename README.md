# Lihtne

Lihtne is a Node.js object-relational mapper (ORM) inspired by Laravel Eloquent. Lihtne is a translation of the magnificent ORM that is Laravel Eloquent.

Lihtne will try to have all the features that Eloquent has, except for those that, due to PHP to JavaScript incompatibilities, cannot be implemented.
